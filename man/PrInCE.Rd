\title{PrInCE: Prediction of Interactomes from Co-Elution}
\usage{
PrInCE(profiles, gold_standard, gaussians = NULL, verbose = F,
  seed = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{profiles}{the co-elution profile matrix, or a list of profile matrices
if replicate experiments were performed. Can be a single numeric matrix,
with proteins in rows and fractions in columns, or a list of matrices}

\item{gold_standard}{a set of 'gold standard' interactions, used to train the
classifier. Can be provided either as an adjacency matrix, in which 
both rows and columns correspond to protein IDs in the co-elution matrix
or matrices, or as a list of proteins in the same complex, which will be
converted to an adjacency matrix by PrInCE. Zeroes in the adjacency matrix 
are interpreted by PrInCE as "true negatives" when calculating precision.}

\item{gaussians}{optionally, provide Gaussian mixture models fit by 
the \code{\link[PrInCE]{build_gaussians}} function. If \code{profiles} is
a numeric matrix, this should be the named list output by 
\code{\link[PrInCE]{build_gaussians}} for that matrix; if \code{profiles} 
is a list of numeric matrices, this should be a list of named lists}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, print a series of messages about the stage
of the analysis}

\item{seed}{the seed for random number generation, to ensure reproducible
output}
}
\value{
a ranked data frame of interacting proteins, with the precision
  at each point in the list

\description{
PrInCE is a computational approach to infer protein-protein interaction 
networks from co-elution proteomics data, also called co-migration,
co-fractionation, or protein correlation profiling. This family of methods
separates interacting protein complexes on the basis of their diameter
or biochemical properties. Protein-protein interactions can then be 
inferred for pairs of proteins with similar elution profiles. PrInCE
implements a machine-learning approach to identify protein-protein 
interactions given a set of labelled examples, using features derived
exclusively from the data. This allows PrInCE to infer high-quality 
protein interaction networks from raw proteomics data, without bias
towards known interactions or functionally associated proteins, making 
PrInCE a unique resource for discovery.

\details{
PrInCE takes as input a co-elution matrix, with detected proteins in rows and
fractions as columns, and a set of 'gold standard' true positives and true
negatives. If replicate experiments were performed, a list of co-elution
matrices can be provided as input. PrInCE will construct features for each
replicate separately and use features from all replicates as input to the
classifier. The 'gold standard' can be either a data frame or adjacency
matrix of known interactions (and non-interactions), or a list of protein
complexes. For computational convenience, Gaussian mixture models can be
pre-fit to every profile and provided separately to the \code{PrInCE} 
function.

PrInCE implements three different types of classifiers to predict 
protein-protein interaction networks, including naive Bayes (the default),
random forests, and support vector machines. The classifiers are trained
on the gold standards using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, training
on 90% of the data and predicting on the remaining 10%. For protein pairs
that are part of the training data, the held-out split is used to assign
a classifier score, whereas for the remaining protein pairs, the median of
all ten folds is used. Furthermore, to ensure the results are not sensitive
to the precise classifier split used, an ensemble of multiple classifiers
(ten, by default) is trained, and the classifier score is subsequently
averaged across classifiers. PrInCE can also ensemble across a set of
classifiers.

By default, PrInCE calculates six features from each pair of co-elution
profiles as input to the classifier, including conventional similarity 
metrics but also several features specifically adapted to co-elution 
proteomics. For example, one such feature is derived
from fitting a Gaussian mixture model to each elution profile, then 
calculating the smallest Euclidean distance between any pair of fitted 
Gaussians. The complete set of features includes:

\enumerate{
  \item the Pearson correlation between raw co-elution profiles;
  \item the p-value of the Pearson correlation between raw co-elution 
    profiles;
  \item the Pearson correlation between cleaned profiles, which are generated
    by imputing single missing values with the mean of their neighbors,
    replacing remaining missing values with random near-zero noise, and 
    smoothing the profiles using a moving average filter (see
    \code{\link[PrInCE]{clean_profile}});
 \item the Euclidean distance between cleaned profiles;
 \item the 'co-peak' score, defined as the distance, in fractions, between 
   the maximum values of each profile; and
 \item the 'co-apex' score, defined as the minimum Euclidean distance between
   any pair of fit Gaussians
}

The output of PrInCE is a ranked data frame, containing the classifier score
for every possible protein pair. PrInCE also calculates the precision at
every point in this ranked list, using the 'gold standard' set of protein
complexes or binary interactions. Our recommendation is to select a 
threshold for the precision and use this to construct an unweighted 
protein interaction network.
